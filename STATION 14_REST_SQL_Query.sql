# Given a table TRIANGLES that holds data for three fields namely A, B, C.
<!-- +-------------+------------+

Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:

Equilateral   : It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
Isosceles     : It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
Scalene       : It's a triangle with  sides of differing lengths.
Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle. -->

WHEN A = B AND B = C THEN 'Equilateral'

# Generate the following two result sets:

1-Query an alphabetically ordered list of all names in OCCUPATIONS, immediately followed by the first letter of each profession as a parenthetical (i.e.: enclosed in parentheses). For example: AnActorName(A), ADoctorName(D), AProfessorName(P), and ASingerName(S).

2-Query the number of ocurrences of each occupation in OCCUPATIONS. Sort the occurrences in ascending order, and output them in the following format:
There are a total of [occupation_count] [occupation]s.
where [occupation_count] is the number of occurrences of an occupation in OCCUPATIONS and [occupation] is the lowercase occupation name. If more than one Occupation has the same [occupation_count], they should be ordered alphabetically.

Note: There will be at least two entries in the table for each type of occupation.

SELECT CONCAT(Name, '(', LEFT(Occupation, 1), ')') AS Result

Note: Print NULL when there are no more names corresponding to an occupation.

# You are given a table, BST, containing two columns: N and P, where N represents the value of a node in Binary Tree, and P is the parent of N.
Write a query to find the node type of Binary Tree ordered by the value of the node. Output one of the following for each node:
Root: If node is root node.
Leaf: If node is leaf node.
Inner: If node is neither root nor leaf node.

# Amber's conglomerate corporation just acquired some new companies. Each of the companies follows this hierarchy: 

Given the table schemas below, write a query to print the company_code, founder name, total number of lead managers, total number of senior managers, total number of managers, and total number of employees. Order your output by ascending company_code.

Note:

The tables may contain duplicate records.
The company_code is string, so the sorting should not be numeric. For example, if the company_codes are C_1, C_2, and C_10, then the ascending company_codes will be C_1, C_10, and C_2.

# Julia asked her students to create some coding challenges. Write a query to print the hacker_id, name, and the total number of challenges created by each student. Sort your results by the total number of challenges in descending order. If more than one student created the same number of challenges, then sort the result by hacker_id. If more than one student
 created the same number of challenges and the count is less than the maximum number of challenges created, then exclude those students from the result.
